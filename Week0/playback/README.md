## About
Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, 
and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, 
or even by having them pause between words.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ranjit-Pokharel/CS50-Python-Problem-Sets.git
